# MLOps Assignment 3 – End-to-End MLOps Pipeline

This project is a complete MLOps pipeline built as part of Assignment 3 for the ML Ops course at IIT Jodhpur.

## Objective
- Train a Linear Regression model on the California Housing dataset.
- Containerize the workflow using Docker.
- Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
- Quantize and optimize the model.

## Branches
- `main` – base setup and coordination
- `dev` – model training with sklearn
- `docker_ci` – containerization and CI/CD
- `quantization` – manual model quantization and PyTorch inference
